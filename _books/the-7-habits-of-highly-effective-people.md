[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36072.The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People) is [Stephen R. Covey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Covey)'s best seller book, in which he presents an approach for effectiveness in attaining goals, aligned with one's character.

I read the book long ago, but I still see it as a great reference for leaders and managers. I practice many of its concepts frequently. Have you ever heard of *circles of influence*, *[P/PC balance](/p-pc-balance)*, or *[the time management matrix](/eisenhower-matrix)*? It all came from this book!

The process goes through 7 habits, from attaining independence, to interdependence and then to continuous improvement, as follows:

1. **Independence** (private victory)
   - Habit 1: Be proactive
   - Habit 2: Begin with the end in mind
   - Habit 3: Put first things first
2. **Interdependence** (public victory)
   - Habit 4: Think win-win
   - Habit 5: Seek first to understand, then to be understood
   - Habit 6: Synergize
3. **Renewal**
   - Habit 7: Sharpen the saw

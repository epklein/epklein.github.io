## Summary

In this book, the author shares 71 short stories about our world, backed by facts and data. 

The book traverses through topics such as energy, environment, food production, health, and technology, using numerical analysis to debunk myths and provide a clearer understanding of complex issues.

I first read [How the World Really Works](/book/how-the-world-really-words), which made me very curious about this one. The truth is, it kind of frustrated me a bit. The book is great, but I enjoyed reading "How the World Really Works" far more.

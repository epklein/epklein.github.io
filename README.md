This project is my homepage and personal blog, which is available at https://eduklein.com.br.

It is a personal project that helps me practice writing in English.

It is a static website written mainly in Markdown, using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

A one-on-one meeting is an individual meeting that managers keep to connect regularly with everyone who directly reports to them. It is a powerful tool for professional development. Some benefits of running one-on-ones include:
- Connect and build trust with your team. Provide a safe space for them to address difficult conversations in private with you;
- Coach your team toward self-improvement and a successful career; Help each individual with what they need for short-term performance and long-term growth;
- Foster organizational culture and your own leadership style;
- Proactively follow up on goals and KPIs;
- Address issues.

## How to Get Started

What do you need to get started? Not much, you just have to:

- Book a weekly one-on-one;
- Have a [shared document](/mgmt/people/template-one-on-one-shared-document) to keep track of the agenda, notes, and actions.

## Running the Meeting

How you run your one-on-ones may vary, and managers may succeed using different approaches. Even the same manager may use different approaches for different people. But some ground rules are usually applicable:

- It is their meeting, not yours. Practice active listening and let them do most of the talking;
- You may support and challenge them but do not solve their problems. Use elicitation techniques to help them arrive at conclusions by themselves;
- Keep a regular schedule, preferably weekly, and avoid rescheduling it;
- It is not a status update meeting, although you may use it occasionally to address issues and follow up on goals.

You may consider the following when running your one-on-ones:

- Start with a question such as "*How are you feeling this week?*" or another alternative from [the questions below](#questions-to-ask). That's a good start because you want them to talk, after all;
- Some status updates may be a bit inevitable in the first minutes, but unless really necessary, try to move away from it as quickly as possible;
- Focus on what they are saying, and move forward with questions that will develop their thoughts. Concentrate on doing this effectively because being a great listener is not easy;
- Have some prepared talking points if the conversation stagnates to make the best of this moment. Choose wisely from [the list of topics below](#topics-for-discussion).

### Questions to Ask

It is nice to ask questions that stimulates the conversation. Some questions that you may ask during one-on-ones:

- How are you feeling this week?
- What's on your mind?
- What went well this week/cycle?
- What are your priorities for the next week/cycle?
- What challenges or roadblocks do you need help with?
- How can I help you?

### Starting a New Relationship

When you take new people as direct reports, you should consider a different approach to getting to know the new person. Some interesting questions include:

- What makes one-on-ones valuable for you?
- Do you have any career goals I should know about to help you achieve?
- Are there any manager behaviors that you dislike?
- Is there anything relevant since you've joined, good or bad, that I should know about?

### Topics for Discussion

There are many relevant topics to cover during one-on-ones. Some of them will be discussed more frequently than others.

Remember that you will usually let your direct report prepare the agenda, but depending on the context (e.g., a big new project, the end of a cycle, a performance issue), you may bring some topics to the conversation.

Some interesting topics you may consider exploring during one-on-ones:

**Personal Life**

- Talk about family, children, hobbies, and dreams; life outside work;
- It's essential to connect personally with your team, as we are all human beings;

**Individual Performance**

- Review results delivered and feedback received; provide your feedback on their results;
- Set goals together for the next cycle;

**Teamwork**

- Discuss team performance and work processes;
- *Do you understand your role within the team?*
- *How would you describe the team's meetings and rituals?*

**Career Development**

- Discuss short, medium, and long-term career goals; challenge their career aspirations;
- Help them explore learning opportunities;
- *Do you enjoy what you do?*
- *What comes next in your development?*

**Organizational Culture, Strategy, and Objectives**

- Share the company's vision and strategy;
- Discuss values and culture;
- *Do you find meaning in what you do?*
- *Do you feel safe at work?*

**For Software Engineers**

- Challenge them to assess and develop relevant hard and soft skills to grow in their careers;
- You may use frameworks and tips from my [SWE career](/mgmt/sem/swe-career) page;

## Taking Notes

A shared document is essential to keep track of your one-on-ones and not get lost.

Some benefits include:

- To prepare the agenda for your next one-on-ones. Both parties should have a document to write down something they don't want to miss the next time they meet;
- Keep track of decisions you made and assigned actions;
- Keep a record of deliveries and achievements;
- Provide your direct reports with a source of information that will help them write their *self-review* during [performance review cycles](/performance-review-cycle);

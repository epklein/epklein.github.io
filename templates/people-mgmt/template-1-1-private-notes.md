## Notes

### 2022-09-21 - Release problems

Alice didn't monitor her last deployment properly, and it caused a high error rate when it went to production. Because of that, we took 2 hours to roll back to our previous version. It was not the first time, so I need to define clearer expectations and have a candid conversation about this incident.

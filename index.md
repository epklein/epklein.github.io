Hello visitor! Welcome!

My name is **Eduardo Klein**, and I'm a Brazillian **Software Engineering Manager**. I'm also a **husband and a proud father of two**. I live with my family in [Porto Alegre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre).

Currently **I work for [VTEX](https://vtex.com/) in the digital commerce industry**. I'm working full remote from my home town. You can understand more about my career in my [About](/about) page and through my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardopklein/).

This **site** is a **personal project to practice writing in English**. So please be patient with me, alright?

I plan to write in the **blog** about a variety of topics, such as my professional experience about **leadership**, **management** and **software engineering**, but also about random stuff such as **books**, **finances** (I really enjoy the stock market), **family** and more.

Feel free to get in touch through my social networks listed in the footer of this site!

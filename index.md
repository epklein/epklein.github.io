Hello and welcome, I am **Eduardo Klein**! I am a Brazilian **software engineering manager** and a proud **husband and father of two**. I live with my family in [Porto Alegre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre), Brazil.

I work for **[VTEX](/about/vtex) in the digital commerce industry**. I am head of engineering for the *Channel Management* team, inside the *Merchant Journey*. My team is responsible for developing and maintain solutions that allow VTEX merchants to sell through external marketplaces. The team is distributed across many states in Brazil and Colombia, and I'm working remotely from my home town.

This **site** is a **personal project to practice writing in English**. I write in the **[blog](/blog)** about a variety of topics, such as my professional experience with **[leadership](/leadership)**, **[management](/mgmt)**, and **[software engineering](/mgmt/swe)**, but also about random stuff such as **books**, **[personal finance](/categories#personal-finance)** (I really enjoy the stock market), **family**, and more.

Hello visitor! Welcome!

My name is **Eduardo Klein**, and I'm a Brazillian **Software Engineering Manager**. I'm also a **husband and a proud father of two**. I live with my family in [Porto Alegre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre).

Currently **I work for [VTEX](https://vtex.com/) in the digital commerce industry**. I have also previous experience in other sectors, notably the financial market and mobile device management. I'm working full remote from my home town. You can understand more about my career from my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardopklein/).

This **site** is a **personal project to practice writing in English**. So please be patient with me, alright?

I plan to write in the **[blog](/blog)** about a variety of topics, such as my professional experience about **[leadership](/leadership)**, **[management](/mgmt)** and **[software engineering](/mgmt/swe)**, but also about random stuff such as **books**, **[finances](/categories/#Finances)** (I really enjoy the stock market), **family** and more.

Feel free to get in touch through my social networks listed in the footer of this site!

Hello visitor! Welcome!

My name is **Eduardo Klein**, and I am a Brazillian **software engineering manager**. I'm also a **husband and a proud father of two**. I live with my family in [Porto Alegre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre).

Currently **I work for [VTEX](https://vtex.com/) in the digital commerce industry**. My team is part of the *Merchant Journey*, and our business vertical inside the journey is responsible for developing and maintain solutions to integrate external marketplaces to the VTEX platform. I'm working remotely from my home town. 

I have also previous experience in software development within the financial market and mobile device management. You can understand more about my career from my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardopklein).

This **site** is a **personal project to practice writing in English**. So please be patient with me, alright?

I plan to write in the **[blog](/blog)** about a variety of topics, such as my professional experience with **[leadership](/leadership)**, **[management](/mgmt)**, and **[software engineering](/mgmt/swe)**, but also about random stuff such as **books**, **[personal finance](/categories/#Personal Finance)** (I really enjoy the stock market), **family**, and more.

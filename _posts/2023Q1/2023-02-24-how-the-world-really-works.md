Today I finished reading *[How the World Really Works](/book/how-the-world-really-works)*, a reading recommendation I received from a [Bill Gates recommended reading video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksImBkJNQt8) and I became really interested in.

In the book, the author shares a lot of science behind our past and our future about energy, food production, globalization, and our environment. He discusses the pillars of our civilization, our dependency on fossil fuels, and global warming, to create awareness and understanding about our future.

This book is imperative reading if you are fond of science and you want to get the numbers to understand our world and the future of it.

I'm looking forward to reading another book from the author, [Numbers don't lie](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50705179-numbers-don-t-lie). I'll probably start soon.

Today I finished reading *[Accelerate](/book/accelerate)*, a book about [DevOps](/swe/devops) and Lean Software Development.

The book explores the capabilities that drive *software delivery performance*. It uncovers 24 capabilities, which are classified in the following 5 categories:

- [Continuous Delivery](/swe/devops/cd)
- Architecture
- Product and process
- Lean management and monitoring
- Cultural

The book then explores each capability and details the research findings.

Take a look at [the book page](/book/accelerate) to read further.

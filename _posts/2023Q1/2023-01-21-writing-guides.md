excerpt: An effective asynchronous communication approach to support your teams in handling specific challenges.

When supporting teams in the many [software engineering](/swe) disciplines, we often help them define approaches to handling specific challenges. Writing them down on documents is an effective way to scale this process.

In his book *[An Elegant Puzzle](/book/an-elegant-puzzle)*, {% include people/will-larson.md %} defines such documents as *strategies*, and he shares a lightweight structure that helps us define clear *strategies* for our teams.

In his own words,

> *Strategies* are grounded documents which explain the trade-offs and actions that will be taken to address a specific challenge.

Although very familiar with writing guides for my teams (I prefer this word to refer to such documents), I found this simple process very helpful in communicating the message, and I started applying it in some documents I share with my teams.

Characteristics of a *strategy*:

- Its purpose is to share an approach to a specific challenge;
- It is practical;
- It is accurate and detailed;

You may write as many as you want. For a development squad, in my perspective, some guides we could define include:

- Effective Backlog refinement;
- Measuring our development process;
- How to write User Stories;
- Our on-call process;
- How to partner with other teams;
- etc.

According to the author, a good *strategy* consists of:

1. *Diagnosis*: The theory describing the challenge at hand, including its factors and constraints, alongwith a problem statement;
2. *Guiding Policies*: These are the policies that will be applied to address the challenge. They describe the general approach taken to tackle the problem;
3. *Actions*: These are the specific steps implemented to address the challenge.

This process is quite similar to how a doctor treats a patient. First, he names the disease or pathology (diagnosis of the problem); Second, he considers the therapeutic approach for it (guiding policy); Finally, he prescribes therapy or medication (actions to be taken).

This month I joined the [Toastmasters International](https://www.toastmasters.org) organization, to pursue my development in [communication](/mgmt/people/communication) and [leadership](/leadership). I joined the [NÃ³s Toastmasters club](https://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club/04830452-04830452), a group that operates in my hometown, Porto Alegre.

Toastmasters International is a non-profit educational organization that operates clubs around the world, with the aim of helping individuals develop their communication and leadership skills. It provides a supportive and positive environment for individuals to practice public speaking, improve their communication skills, and develop leadership abilities.

Toastmasters also offers an educational program called Pathways, which is designed to help members achieve specific communication and leadership goals through a series of projects and assignments. Pathways provides a self-paced, customizable learning experience tailored to individual needs and interests.

I've chosen the **Dynamic Leadership** as my first Pathway. It focuses on building skills as a strategic leader, understanding leadership and communication styles, the effect of conflict on a group, and the skills needed to defuse and direct conflict.

I'm excited for taking part on this, to develop my skills and to help other Toastmasters in their journeys. I plan to write about this under the [#toastmasters](/categories#toastmasters) category.

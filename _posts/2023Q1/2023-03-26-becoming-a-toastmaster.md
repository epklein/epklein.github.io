This month I joined the [Toastmasters International](https://www.toastmasters.org) organization to pursue my development in [communication](/mgmt/people/communication) and [leadership](/leadership). I joined the [NÃ³s Toastmasters Club](https://www.toastmasters.org/Find-a-Club/04830452-04830452), a group from my hometown, Porto Alegre.

Toastmasters International is a non-profit educational organization that operates clubs around the world to help individuals develop their communication and leadership skills. It provides a supportive and positive environment for individuals to practice public speaking, improve communication skills, and develop leadership abilities.

Toastmasters also offer an educational program called Pathways, designed to help members achieve specific communication and leadership goals through a series of projects and assignments. Pathways provides a self-paced, customizable learning experience tailored to individual needs and interests.

I've chosen **Dynamic Leadership** as my first Pathway. It focuses on building skills as a strategic leader, understanding leadership and communication styles, the effect of conflict on a group, and the skills needed to defuse and direct conflict.

I'm excited to take part in this, to develop my skills, and to help other Toastmasters in their journeys. I plan to write about this under the [#toastmasters](/categories#toastmasters) category.

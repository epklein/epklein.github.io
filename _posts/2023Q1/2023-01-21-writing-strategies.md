Whe supporting teams in the many disciplines of [software engineering](/swe), quite often we help them define approaches on how to handle specific challenges. Writing them down on documents is an effective way to scale this process.

In his book [An Elegant Puzzle](https://amzn.to/3FPKYbg), [Will Larson](https://lethain.com/) defines such documents as *Strategies*, and he shares a lightweight structure that helps us define clear *strategies* to our teams.

In his own words,

> *Strategies* are grounded documents which explain the trade-offs and actions that will be taken to address a specific challenge.

Although very familiar with writing this kind of document, I found this simple process to be very helpful to communicate the message, and I started applying it in some documents I share with my teams.

Characteristics of an *Strategy*:

- Its purpose is to share an approach to a specific challenge;
- It is practical;
- It is accurate and detailed;

You may write as many as you want. For a development squad, in my perspective, some of the strategies we could define include:

- Effective Backlog refinement;
- Measuring our development process;
- How to write User Stories;
- Our on-call process;
- How to partner with other teams;
- etc.

According to the author, a good strategy consists of:

1. *Diagnosis*: It is the theory describing the challenge at hand - its factors and constraints - and a problem statement;
2. *Policies*: Those are the policies that we will apply to address the challenge. It describes the general approach that we take to tackle the problem;
3. *Actions*: Those are the specific steps that we implement to address the challenge.


It is quite similar to how a doctor treats a patient. First he names the disease or pathology (diagnosis of the problem); Second, he considers the therapeutic approach for it (guiding policy); Finally, he prescribes a therapy or medication (actions to be taken).

*[How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4865.How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People)*, written by [Dale Carnegie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Carnegie), is one of my preferred books; One that I highly recommend everyone reading. I already read it twice and probably it is time to read it again.

It is a great lesson about relationships, [influence](/tags#influence) and, why not, [leadership](/leadership). Why? Because leadership is all about influencing other people. And I think Carnegie's lessons are really inspiring.

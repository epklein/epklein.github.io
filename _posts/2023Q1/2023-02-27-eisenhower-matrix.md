The Eisenhower Matrix is a straightforward and popular time management tool that I was first introduced to in *[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](/book/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people)*[^1], written by Stephen Covey, many years ago. It can help you **get organized and execute around priorities**.

When you categorize your activities into four quadrants, with the help of the matrix, you can quickly identify what you should prioritize first. Let's take a look at the matrix:

![The Time Management Matrix](/images/posts/2023-02-27-eisenhower-matrix/the-time-management-matrix.webp "The Time Management Matrix, by Stephen Covey.")

As you can see, the two factors that define an activity are *urgent* and *important*. *Urgent* means that the activity requires immediate attention. They are usually visible and press on us. *Importance* has to do with results; if the activity is important to you, it contributes to your mission, values, and high-priority goals.

**We react to urgent matters, but important matters require initiative and proactivity!**

The quadrants can be read as follows:

<ol type="I">
  <li><b>Urgent and important</b>: This quadrant deals with significant results that require immediate attention;</li>
  <li><b>Important but not urgent</b>: This quadrant is the heart of effective personal management. It deals with important, but not urgent, activities;</li>
  <li><b>Urgent but not important</b>: This quadrant deals with urgent activities that are usually a priority for someone else, not for you;</li>
  <li><b>Not urgent and not important</b>: It is usually stuff that is pleasant to do but has no significance.</li>
</ol>


It is important to take into consideration that:

- People who spend most of their time in quadrant I live by crisis. This quadrant dominates them. If you are there, you should consider how to shrink quadrant I and move to quadrant II, where you are more effective;
- Effective people avoid quadrants III and IV. You should consider delegating quadrant III activities when possible. Avoid quadrant IV activities altogether; this should be your "do not do" list.

[^1]: As far as I understand, the matrix was created by Stephen Covey. He refers to it as *The Time Management Matrix*, however. The matrix is widely known as the Eisenhower Matrix, in honor of USA 34ยบ president [Dwight D. Eisenhower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower), but I don't know by whom and when the matrix was named the Eisenhower Matrix.

excerpt: Understanding communication expectations and levels to enhance team communication and collaboration.

Effective communication is vital for successful product development teams in tech companies, including software engineering teams. As software engineers (SWEs) and [software engineering managers](/mgmt/sem/sem-role) (SEMs), our focus often leans heavily on technical excellence and delivery processes. Yet, without clear communication, great ideas and initiatives can fail.

In tech companies, where cross-functional collaboration is crucial, the ability to convey complex ideas clearly is not just a nice-to-have — it’s essential. Effective communication bridges gaps between leadership, product and growth teams, partners, and clients, ensuring alignment and shared understanding. However, many teams struggle to articulate their thoughts or adapt their language to diverse audiences, leading to misunderstandings and inefficiencies.

In this post, I share my perspective on the varying levels of communication skills for SWEs within tech companies. By breaking down the competency of effective communication into actionable levels — from beginner to expert — I aim to provide a framework that SEMs can use to assess and develop their team's communication skills.

This structure can also be integrated into career ladders, supporting personal development and career progression. It can help SWEs identify growth opportunities and set clear goals, fostering an environment where communication flows freely, and product development thrives.

## Effective Communication Expectations and Levels

To make effective communication more tangible, I will describe it through four dimensions:

1. **Empathy and Perspective-Taking**: Understands and appreciates others' feelings and viewpoints. Empathizes with others to better understand and address their concerns.
2. **Active Listening**: Fully concentrates on and understands what is being said. Acknowledges the speaker and gives feedback to show understanding.
3. **Clarity**: Expresses ideas in a straightforward and clear way. Uses precise words and logical sentences. Avoids jargon to minimize misunderstandings.
4. **Adaptability**: Adjusts communication style for different audiences. Modifies language and tone to ensure the message resonates.

I try to establish adequate expectations for each level and provide evidence and examples.

### Beginner

- **Empathy and Perspective-Taking**: Demonstrates basic awareness of the need to understand and consider others' viewpoints. Begins to ask questions to clarify others' perspectives.
- **Active Listening**: Listens to others but occasionally interrupts or misses key points.
- **Clarity**: Communicates basic ideas clearly but may struggle with complex topics. Uses jargon without ensuring others understand.
- **Adaptability**: Tends to use the same communication style regardless of the audience and may need guidance to adjust language for different stakeholders.

#### Evidence

- Listens attentively during team meetings and one-on-ones
- Asks clarifying questions when unsure about tasks or requirements
- Communicates project status and blockers to immediate team members
- Uses basic technical terminology correctly in team discussions
- Writes clear documentation for their code and processes

#### Example

- An engineer who effectively explains their work to colleagues, using simple language and checking for understanding through questioning.

### Competent

- **Empathy and Perspective-Taking**: Regularly attempts to understand others’ perspectives and asks clarifying questions to ensure they grasp the other person's viewpoint.
- **Active Listening**: Demonstrates consistent active listening by paraphrasing and summarizing others’ points.
- **Clarity**: Communicates more complex ideas clearly and tailors messages to the audience.
- **Adaptability**: Adjusts communication style for different audiences but may need support to fully align with stakeholders’ needs or preferences.

#### Evidence

- Actively participates in team discussions and contributes ideas
- Facilitates productive team meetings and discussions
- Adapts communication style when speaking with non-technical teammates
- Provides regular, unprompted updates on project progress
- Explains technical concepts to junior team members effectively
- Prepares and delivers presentations and demos on their work
- Writes comprehensive technical documents and proposals

#### Example

- An engineer who leads team meetings and technical discussions, as well as ensures all participants understand the key points by summarizing and asking for feedback.

### Proficient

- **Empathy and Perspective-Taking**: Consistently considers and integrates multiple perspectives into communication. Demonstrates empathy in discussions and decision-making.
- **Active Listening**: Engages in active listening as a natural part of communication. Frequently verifies mutual understanding and encourages others to express their views.
- **Clarity**: Communicates complex technical ideas clearly and effectively, adapting language and style to suit diverse audiences. Regularly ensures mutual understanding.
- **Adaptability**: Flexibly adjusts communication style based on audience feedback and context. Proactively seeks to build a common vocabulary where necessary.

#### Evidence

- Communicates complex technical ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences
- Negotiates effectively with leadership and other stakeholders
- Presents confidently to larger groups, including leadership and cross-functional teams
- Proactively addresses potential miscommunications or conflicts within the team

#### Example

- An engineer who facilitates cross-functional meetings, including leadership, using clear and concise language to ensure all stakeholders understand the discussion.

### Expert

- **Empathy and Perspective-Taking**: Intuitively understands and anticipates others' perspectives and needs. Guides conversations to foster understanding and collaboration.
- **Active Listening**: Exemplifies active listening, creating an environment where others feel heard and valued. Facilitates discussions, ensuring all voices are included and understood.
- **Clarity**: Articulates complex ideas with exceptional clarity and precision across diverse audiences. Coaches others in effective communication strategies.
- **Adaptability**: Seamlessly adapts communication style to suit any audience, situation, or context. Establishes and promotes effective communication norms within teams and across the organization.

#### Evidence

- Develops and implements communication strategies for large-scale projects
- Represents the engineering team in high-level discussions with executives and external partners
- Mediates complex discussions and conflicts across multiple teams
- Delivers compelling presentations at company-wide events or conferences
- Creates and maintains a shared technical vocabulary across the organization
- Writes influential articles or blog posts that enhance the company's reputation in the tech community
- Coaches other leaders on effective communication techniques
- Establishes communication best practices and guidelines for the entire engineering organization

#### Example

- An engineer who leads initiatives across the company, ensuring all stakeholders have a common understanding. 

## Conclusion

Effective communication is a multifaceted skill that is crucial for the success of tech teams. By focusing on those four dimensions, we can create a structured approach to developing these competencies within our teams.

Setting clear expectations for each level of communication proficiency allows [SEMs](/mgmt/sem/sem-role) to guide their teams toward continuous improvement.

This framework provides engineers with a roadmap for growth, helping them identify where they are, where they want to go, and what skills they need to develop along the way.

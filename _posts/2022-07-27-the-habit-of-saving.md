title: The Habit of Saving

Building the habit of consistently saving a part of what you earn is a fundamental principle of most, if not all, approaches to build wealth.

Lets say you save 10% to 20% of what you earn, sistematically. **In the long run you can accumulate far more than the sum of what you saved every month**, if you invest it wisely.

But that habit may be read differently from other people's perspectives:

1. Some may see it as being a petty habit. You sacrifice the present while thinking in a future that may never arrive. You don't take the best of life.
2. Others may see it radically different. You seek abundance. Of money and of time, security, leisure, learning. Financial independence.

I see it the second way. But most of the time I feel judged by the first way of thinking, which for me is very limited (immediatist, consumerist).

**I believe that, when you save a part of what you earn, you are paing yourself. When you don't, you pay everyone else but you.**

That's because, that **ammount you are saving, it is going to work for you**. By consistently saving a part of what I earn, and investing it appropriately, I can succeed in many ways:

- I can offer security and stability to my family;
- I can face temporary adversities of our capitalist life far easier (crisis, unemployment, accidents of any sort, ...);
- I can avoid debt, if I want, when I wish to conquer bigger goals;
- I can invest in learning, which will improve my earning capacity, as well as my saving and investing capacity, proportionally;
- I can more easily embrace opportunities life puts in front of me;
- I can offer more and better opportunities to my family (traveling, school, university, ...);
- In the long run, I can have far more than I would be able to have by living without the saving habit.

**All that is about abundance. More of security, of flexibility, of opportunities, of freedom**. It takes effort and discipline. It is not easy. But it is certainly worth paying the price.

Career development is essential to reaching our potential. Committing to self-improvement enhances our current roles and prepares us for future opportunities and challenges. As the owners of our professional journeys, we must continually expand and adapt our skills.

Our careers are not just defined by what we work on but mainly by what we aspire to become. This pursuit is a continuous effort that shapes our career aspirations and enhances learning, contributing to personal growth and collective success in companies.

To empower individuals and facilitate career advancement, I've documented a structured approach to guide the process. It consists of:

- **Resources**: A collection of guides and templates that help you understand how to pursue career development;
- **Tools**: The tools that help you navigate the journey, leveraging your relationship with your manager and peers;
- **Approach**: A structured approach to go from envisioning your desired future to realizing tangible growth.

# Resources

- [Individual Development Plan (IDP) template](/personal-dev/template-individual-development-plan): A straightforward template to help you create your development plan;
- **Your company's career track**: This is something your company should provide. It is essential to understand the career track laid out by your organization. Learn how to progress in your career by discussing with your manager. Learn more about software engineering career ladders and progression frameworks [here](/mgmt/sem/swe-career);
- **Your company's performance review process**: This information should also be provided by your company or manager. Most organizations have a documented schedule and process for performance reviews. It is beneficial to align your development plan with it to ensure your goals are in sync with the company's expectations;
- **Your company's and team's strategy and vision**: This information should also be provided by your company or manager. Understanding your company's and team's strategy and vision is crucial. It helps you identify relevant projects and opportunities that align with your objectives and contribute to organizational goals.

# Tools

The following is a collection of tools that you can leverage, together with your manager, to communicate your goals, commit to them, and progress in your career.

## One-on-one meetings

A [one-on-one](/mgmt/people/one-on-ones) is a recurring, individual meeting that managers schedule with each team member. Its primary goal is to support your career development, providing a platform for discussing professional growth, addressing tactical issues, and receiving guidance and feedback. They are also an opportunity for you to share feedback, raise concerns, and discuss your aspirations.

Ideally, this meeting should occur regularly, preferably weekly, to ensure consistent communication and support. If you're not currently having these meetings, I recommend you talk to your manager to establish a schedule.

Some advice for your one-on-ones:

- Connect with your manager. Let them know about yourself, your desired future, and your dreams and goals. Your manager should be the person to help you maximize your development inside the company.
- To make the most of this relationship, own the one-on-one agenda. It is about you, not about them, so be proactive in bringing topics to the table. Don't expect your manager to guide your development; do it yourself.

## Feedback

Feedback is a powerful tool for personal and professional growth. It involves both giving and receiving constructive comments about performance, behavior, or learning strategies. Regular feedback can help you understand your strengths, identify areas for improvement, and align your efforts with your team's and organization's objectives.

Some advice on feedback:

- **Seek feedback often**: Don't wait for formal reviews. Ask for feedback regularly from your manager, peers, etc;
- **Be specific in your requests**: Instead of asking for general feedback, focus on specific areas or recent projects;
- **Create a feedback-friendly culture**: Encourage open and honest communication within your team. Show appreciation for the feedback you receive, and be respectful and constructive when giving feedback to others.
- **Act on the feedback**: Demonstrating that you value and act upon feedback is crucial. Reflect on it, make necessary adjustments, and use it as a stepping stone for growth.

Remember, effective use of feedback is a key component in driving your personal development and achieving your career goals.

## Individual Development Plan

An Individual Development Plan (IDP) is a document you create, preferably in collaboration with your manager. It serves as a roadmap for career growth and skill development, outlining specific, achievable objectives aligned with both your career aspirations and your team's and the organization's goals. 

The creation of an IDP is a proactive process. Reflect on your strengths, feedback received, areas for improvement, and long-term career goals when writing it. Regular reviews and updates to the IDP are crucial, as they allow for adjustments based on progress, changing circumstances, or evolving career objectives.

An effective IDP not only guides an individual's professional development but also fosters a culture of continuous learning and growth within the organization. If you haven't developed your IDP yet, consider scheduling time with your manager to start this valuable process.

# Taking the driver's seat

As we have established, owning our personal development is crucial. I strongly encourage you to take the driver's seat on this journey. Commit to your self-improvement and intentionally chart the course of your career.

If you're uncertain about where to begin, the following is a structured approach to navigating your personal development.

## Leverage your one-on-ones

You should count on your manager to support you in every aspect of your personal development plan. Ensuring that your goals are aligned with the team's objectives and the organization's vision is key to success.

One-on-one meetings with your manager are invaluable opportunities to drive your personal development forward. Use these sessions to discuss your goals and your development plan, celebrate your wins, navigate through challenges, and adjust your goals as needed.

Be proactive in seeking guidance, clarifying expectations, and securing the support you need. These interactions can give you the insights and motivation to propel your career development.

## Clarify your desired future

Consider what success looks like for you in the long term: the roles you aspire to fill, the skills you wish to master, and the impact you want to make. Reflect on your interests and passions and how they align with your career aspirations.

This clarity of vision is the compass that will guide all subsequent steps in your career journey.

Consider the following in this step:

- While your vision of the desired future provides direction, remember it's equally important to remain adaptable. As you grow personally and professionally, your aspirations evolve. Make it a practice to reflect on and revise your vision at least annually.
- In case of a shift in your desired future, you must communicate these changes to your manager. Together, you can discuss the implications of this change on your current role and explore a transition plan that aligns with your new objectives.

## Define your development objectives

Once you have a clear picture of your desired future, it's time to set specific development objectives. These are the milestones that will mark your progress along the path to your ultimate career goals.

Consider the following in this step:

- Regularly review and update your objectives to stay aligned with both your personal growth and the organization's evolving landscape. A quarterly review, synchronized with the company's performance or planning cycles, can ensure your goals remain relevant and achievable.
- Less is more. Aim for a manageable number of objectives that allow for focused effort and significant impact.
- Stay agile in your career planning. If there are shifts in your teamâ€™s vision or organizational structure, view them as opportunities to realign your objectives. Adapting your goals to new circumstances can open up unexpected avenues for growth and learning.

## Build your Individual Development Plan (IDP)

With your objectives set, you can now craft your Individual Development Plan (IDP). This personalized plan is your strategy for achieving your career goals. It should outline the resources you'll need, the skills you'll develop, and the steps you'll take. Your IDP is a living document that will evolve as you progress, so it's essential to revisit and revise it regularly.

## Tracking Progress

Once your IDP is established, the next critical phase is implementation and tracking. This is where you put your plan into motion, actively engaging with the outlined activities and learning opportunities.

Establish a routine for regularly reviewing your progress against your objectives. This could be a monthly self-assessment or a tracking spreadsheet. Such vigilant monitoring will help you stay accountable, make necessary adjustments, and maintain momentum toward achieving your goals.

## Ask for feedback

Feedback is the fuel for growth and improvement. Regularly seek out constructive feedback from a variety of sources: managers, peers, mentors, and other people. Embrace both positive and constructive criticism as opportunities to learn and refine your skills.

Remember, feedback is not just about hearing what you're doing well but also about identifying areas where you can improve. By actively asking for and acting on feedback, you demonstrate your commitment to continuous learning and self-improvement.

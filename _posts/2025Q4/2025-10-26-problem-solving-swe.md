excerpt: Understanding problem-solving expectations and levels to build a robust engineering toolkit and advance your career.

Problem-solving is at the heart of [software engineering](/swe). Whether debugging a production issue, designing a new system, or optimizing performance, the ability to approach challenges methodically and effectively distinguishes exceptional engineers.

In tech companies, where complexity scales rapidly and novel challenges emerge daily, strong problem-solving skills are non-negotiable. Yet, for many engineers, it is challenging to define what "good" problem-solving looks like or how to develop these capabilities systematically. Without a clear framework, it's difficult to assess growth, identify development areas, or set meaningful career goals.

In this post, I share my perspective on the varying levels of problem-solving competency for software engineers within tech companies. By breaking down this skill into actionable levels — from beginner to expert — I aim to provide a framework that [software engineering managers](/mgmt/sem/sem-role) (SEMs) can use to assess and develop their team's problem-solving capabilities.

This is similar to the work I've previously done for [Effective Communication](/effective-communication-swe), which I'll compile with other skills at some point in the future into a guide for software engineering competencies.

This structure can be integrated into career ladders, supporting personal development and career progression. It can help engineers identify growth opportunities and set clear goals, fostering an environment where challenges are approached confidently and systematically, and product development thrives.

## Problem-Solving Expectations and Levels

To make problem-solving more tangible, I will describe it through five dimensions:

1. **Framework and Tool Proficiency**: Masters a variety of frameworks, tools, and libraries commonly used to solve engineering problems, enabling efficient and effective solutions.
2. **Coding and Design Craftsmanship**: Demonstrates the ability to craft elegant, efficient, and maintainable code solutions through the thoughtful application of algorithms, data structures, and design patterns.
3. **Architectural Understanding**: Develops architectural solutions that address complex system requirements and integration challenges, ensuring scalability, reliability, and maintainability.
4. **Analytical Thinking**: Breaks down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts and systematically approaches their resolution using appropriate strategies.
5. **Continuous Learning and Practice**: Engages in continuous learning to acquire new problem-solving methods and improve existing skills through regular practice and exploration of emerging technologies.

I try to establish adequate expectations for each level and provide evidence and examples.

## Conclusion

Problem-solving forms the foundation of effective software engineering. By focusing on these five dimensions, we can create a structured approach to developing these competencies within our teams.

Setting clear expectations for each level of problem-solving proficiency allows [SEMs](/mgmt/sem/sem-role) to guide their teams toward continuous improvement. Like building a utility belt of tools and techniques, developing problem-solving skills is an ongoing journey that requires deliberate practice and regular refinement.

This framework provides engineers with a roadmap for growth, helping them identify where they are, where they want to go, and what skills they need to develop along the way.

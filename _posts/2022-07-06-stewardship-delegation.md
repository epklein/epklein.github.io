[Delegation](/mgmt/delegation) is the act of giving someone else, or a group of people, authority or responsibility for something. There are many techniques on how to delegate properly, and the best approach may depend on the context.

In [managing software engineering teams](/mgmt/swe), I prefer a delegation approach focused on the results instead of methods. Which takes more time and energy to see results, but develops people abilities and scales in the long run.

One simple approach to delegate focused on results is the Stewardship delegation, shared by Stephen Covey in his best-seller book [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](/books/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people).

> Stewardship delegation involves clear, up-front mutual understanding and commitment regarding expectations in five areas:
> - **Desired results**: Create a clear, mutual understanding of what needs to be accomplished, focusing on what, not how; results, not methods.
> - **Guidelines**: Identify the parameters within which the individual should operate... If you know the failure paths of the job, identify them.... Keep the responsibility for results with them - to do whatever is necessary within the guidelines.
> - **Resources**: Identify the human, financial, technical, or organizational resources the person can draw on to accomplish the desired results.
> - **Accountability**: Set up the standards of performance that will be used in evaluating the results and the specific times when reporting and evaluation will take place.
> - **Consequences**: Specify what will happen, both good and bad, as a result of the evaluation.

In my daily work, I don't formally use this process, but I like to reflect on those five areas when I'm delegating a project or activity to an engineer.

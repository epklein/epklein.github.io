Effective [communication](/mgmt/people/communication) is a skill that is underrated yet highly impactful in our daily interactions.

It is a challenging skill to master, especially for an introvert like myself. It requires study and intentional practice. I've read many books that cover this topic to better communicate in business.

I have the chance to speak to many people and groups of people daily as a leader in tech companies, and I still feel like a beginner.

I recently came across [a great Ted Talk by Celeste Headlee](https://www.ted.com/talks/celeste_headlee_10_ways_to_have_a_better_conversation), full of practical tips to improve our conversations. I highly recommend you watch it.

I want to highlight from that speech three tips that I believe are crucial to communicating effectively with other people:

### Don't multitask

Our brains are terrible at multitasking. Everyone's brain; yours is not an exception!

Have you ever been asked in a meeting: "What do you think?" but you were in another world, and you had no idea what were they talking about? I've been there, either; it is horrible. We feel miserable, lose respect, and make people mad at us.

Avoid distractions and avoid half-hearted participation. Being present and focusing on the person or group you are communicating with lets you make the most of the conversation. And you also get the respect and interest from others.

### Admit when you don't know

Be careful about what you claim to be an expert in and what you claim to know for sure.

Have you been in the spot of talking to someone who assures you they know something you are confident is wrong, but they don't accept "losing" the argument? Oh, does this behavior repeats? Yeah, the person loses your credibility.

You never know if you can trust the person, and it is exhausting, if possible, to prove they are wrong when the stakes are high.

You build trust by openly admitting you don't know or are unsure of something.

### Listen

Last but not least, listening is the most important skill to develop for effective communication. When listening, we learn, build empathy, show appreciation, and bring the other person to the conversation.

I think I first learned the lesson about listening and getting interested in others from Dale Carnegie in *[How to Win Friends and Influence People](/book/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people)* when he says: "You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you."

Another great quote comes from Stephen Covey in *[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](/book/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people)*: "Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand. We listen with the intent to reply".

Let's finish paying attention to what Buddha said: "If your mouth is open, you're not learning."

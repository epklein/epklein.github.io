[Delegation](/mgmt/people/delegation) is the act of giving someone else, or a group of people, authority or responsibility for something. There are many techniques for delegating properly; the best approach may depend on the context.

In [managing software engineering teams](/mgmt/swe), I prefer a delegation approach focused on results instead of methods. This takes more time and energy to see results but develops people's abilities and scales in the long run.

A straightforward approach focused on results is the **stewardship delegation**, shared by Stephen Covey in his best-seller book *[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](/book/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people)*.

> Stewardship delegation involves clear, up-front mutual understanding and commitment regarding expectations in five areas:
> - **Desired results**: Create a clear, mutual understanding of what needs to be accomplished, focusing on what, not how; results, not methods.
> - **Guidelines**: Identify the parameters within which the individual should operate. If you know the failure paths of the job, identify them. Keep the responsibility for results with them - to do whatever is necessary within the guidelines.
> - **Resources**: Identify the human, financial, technical, or organizational resources the person can draw on to accomplish the desired results.
> - **Accountability**: Set up the standards of performance that will be used in evaluating the results and the specific times when reporting and evaluation will take place.
> - **Consequences**: Specify what will happen, both good and bad, as a result of the evaluation.

Food for thought: I don't usually use this process by the book in my daily work, but I like to reflect on those five areas when delegating a project or activity to an engineer.

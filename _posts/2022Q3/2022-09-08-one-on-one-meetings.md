A [one-on-one](/mgmt/people/one-on-ones) is an individual meeting that a manager keeps to connect regularly to everyone that directly reports to him. It is a powerful tool for professional development. Some benefits of running one-on-ones include:

- Connect and build trust with your team. Provide a safe space for them to address difficult conversations in private with you;
- Coach your team toward self-improvement and a successful career;
- Foster organizational culture and your own leadership style;
- Proactively follow-up on goals and KPIs;
- Address issues.

How you run your one-on-ones may vary, and managers may succeed using different approaches. Even the same manager may use different approaches for different people. But there are some ground rules that usually are usually applicable:

- It is their meeting, not yours. Practice active listening and let them do most of the talking;
- You may support and challenge them, but do not solve their problems. Use elicitation techniques to help them arrive at conclusions by themselves;
- Keep a regular schedule, preferably weekly, and avoid rescheduling it;
- It is not a status update meeting, although once in a while you may use it for that, to address issues and follow-up on goals.

What you need to get started? Not much, you just need:

- To book a weekly one-to-one;
- To have a shared document to keep track of agenda, notes, and planned actions

Running it effectively requires practice, and some guidelines or tips may be of great help. What to talk about during one-one-ones? How to take notes and keep track of it? I'll regularly share in the blog my experience and the resources I use to conduct one-on-one meetings.

Stay tuned ;)

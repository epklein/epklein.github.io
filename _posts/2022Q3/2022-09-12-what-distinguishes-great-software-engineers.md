Recently I read the article "[What Distinguishes Great Software Engineers?](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/papers/Li2019WhatDistinguishesEngineers.pdf)" ([Springer link](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-019-09773-y)), published in 2019 by Paul Luo Li, Amy J. Ko, and Andrew Begel, which **synthesizes their findings of the key characteristics that distinguishes great software engineers**.

Their research covered 54 attributes of a [previous study](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/37160) and concluded that:

> the top five distinguishing characteristics of great engineers are writing good code, adjusting behaviors to account for future value and costs, practicing informed decision-making, avoiding making othersâ€™ jobs harder, and learning continuously.

For a **software engineering manager**, I think that is also **a great reference of what skills to help teams develop**.

Let's jump to the must-have characteristics identified by their research, which surveyed 1926 expert engineers:

| <nobr>Rank #</nobr> | Attribute and description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Pays attention to coding details, such as error handling, memory, performance, style |
| 2 | Mentally capable of handling complexity; can comprehend multiple interacting software components |
| 3 | Continuously improving: improves themselves, their product, or their surroundings |
| 4 | Honest: provide credible information and feedback that others can act on |
| 5 | Open-minded: lets new information change their thinking |
| 6 | Executes: knows when to stop thinking and to start doing |
| 7 | Self-reliant: gets things done independently and does not get blocked easily |
| 8 | Self-reflecting: recognizes when things are going wrong with a plan and pivots |
| 9 | Persevering: not dissuaded by setbacks and failures |
| 10 | Fits together with other pieces around it: code accounts for surrounding constraints and products. |
| 11 | Knowledgeable about their technical domain, including product, platform, and competitors |
| 12 | Makes informed trade-offs: code is responsive to time to market goals, critical needs of the business |
| 13 | Updates their decision making knowledge: does not let their understanding stagnate |
| 14 | Curious: desires to know why things happen and how things work |
| 15 | Evolving: code is structured to be effectively built, delivered, and updated incrementally |

The attributes were ranked along a scale of *must have*, *should have*, *nice to have*, *irrelevant*, and *should not have*. If you want to check the complete list, check [the article](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/papers/Li2019WhatDistinguishesEngineers.pdf).

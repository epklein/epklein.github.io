Here at VTEX the **Tech Org** is currently running the *Performance Review Cycle* for 2022/H2. We run it twice a year.

The whole team gets involved in the process, which demands a reasonable amount of time from everyone.

## What is Performance?

So what is performance at VTEX? In my own words:

> **Overall performance** is a result of how consistent delivered results are over expectations, and respect for VTEX foundations.

In a nutshell:

- We recognize results delivered during the cycle, and not the efforts to achieve them;
- Every professional is compared to the expectations for their level;
- All that must be aligned with VTEX Foundations, our culture.

The People Team at VTEX offers a comprehensive handbook to guide the entire process. An important artifact from it is the *Conditions of Satisfaction* manual.

## How is the Review Cycle Structured?

The whole process consists of three main phases:

1. **Performance review**: During this phase everyone dedicates time to write their own *self review*, their manager's review (*upward review*), and some *peer reviews* when asked for it. After that, it is the time where managers write the *manager review* for each direct report;
2. **Calibration**: With the output from phase 1, it is time for calibration. This is the moment where manager's reviews are discussed on leadership committees to promote fair weights among managers and remove bias;
3. **Performance feedback and development plan**: In this last phase, managers prepare a structured feedback about the cycle. Based on the feedback and career motivations, manager and individuals design together a development plan (IDP) for the next cycle. For those below expectations, managers may develop an improvement plan (PIP) for the next cycle.

This is a concise description of a complex and well structured process that takes more than a month do finish. In my understanding, the whole performance review cycle at VTEX is aligned with practices from the tech industry. I see many similarities with how **big tech** run their performance evaluations.

*[Code Kata](/swe/coding/code-kata)* is a programming exercise that helps software developers improve their coding skills through practice.

The term *Kata* comes from Japanese culture, initially from martial arts. A *Kata* consists of a choreographed pattern of movements that are practiced, solo or in a group, to achieve mastery of the movements.

There are many great websites that share tons of exercises where software developers can practice their coding skills in various programming languages, such as [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), which I'm currently using to practice.

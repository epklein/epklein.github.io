The right size of a software engineering team and the number of engineers an Engineering Manager (EM) can properly support is at the core of organizational design in tech companies.

The [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-team) states that "*The Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people*". The Two-Pizza Teams, coined by [Jeff Bezos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos) at [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)), also says that "*We try to create teams that are no larger than can be fed by two pizzas*", which I guess can't feed more than 8 or 9 people.

A more accurate answer depends on how the team operates. Teams at big tech, for example, are responsible for innovation, keeping the lights on, on-call processes, among other responsibilities. By the way, those teams are usually [not running the Scrum framework to manage projects](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/project-management-in-tech) anyway.

The truth is, this question has been puzzling me for a while. I feel I've been in both extremes of this *dilemma*: Small teams that lack skills and are highly impacted by vacation, on-call, sick leave, etc.; and big teams that get too complex to manage, loose focus easier, and don't adapt fast. Both usually don't perform as expected.

Being in the EM's seat, having a small team impels you to act hands on with your engineers, whereas with a big team you can't properly support all engineers the way you wish. Neither helps your career development as an Engineering Manager.

In his book [An Elegant Puzzle](https://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/B07QYCHJ7V), [Will Larson](https://lethain.com/) offers, from his experience, a playbook on sizing teams at big tech, which I feel is well aligned with my perceptions.

From his playbook we can get valuable insights:

1. Managers should support 6 to 8 engineers
	- Those who supports fewer than 4 engineers are hands on Tech Lead Mangers (TLMs)
	- Those who supports more than 8 engineers, typically act as **coaches** and **safety nets for problems**
2. Managers of managers should support 4 to 6 managers
	- Managers supporting fewer than 4 managers should be in a period of active learning (Ramp up)
	- Coaches: Supporting more than 6 managers leaves you functioning purely as a problem-solving coach
3. On-call rotations want 8 engineers
4. Small teams (fewer than four members) are not considered teams

This is a simple and straightforward set of principles that can guide the way we organize teams effectively.

The way we communicate to other people has a big impact on the effectiveness of the message we want to deliver.

How we deliver the message - the words we choose, our rhetoric, our body language - and the context changes the way we touch and influence people around us.

Recently I came across this interesting video on *The Power of Words*, from 2015 [Toastmasters International](https://www.toastmasters.org/) public speaking champion [Mohammed Qahtani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammed-qahtani-08b90931/). It is a 3-minute video that I highly recommend you watching.

In a leadership position, effective [communication](/mgmt/people/communication) is an important ability to develop. Just to enlighten a bit of the positive impact you can cause from it:

- You can improve performance;
- You can help your circle of influence to overcome difficult situations;
- You can expand your circle of influence;
- You can promote and even shape organizational culture.

## Communication as a Software Engineering Manager

In James Stanier words (from *[Become an effective software engineering manager](https://amzn.to/3cc4BOs)*)

> Remember that as a manager, your word has weight as it doesn't only come from you: it comes from an established position in the company's org chart. As a manager you represent yourself, your team, and your company as a whole. Be a role model for those around you.

In my experience as a software engineering manager I see that, by communicating effectively, you shape your team's behavior, impact their morale and directly support them to develop their careers. And the other way around, with poor communication.

## Communication at VTEX

At VTEX, we strongly believe that high-performance communication drives the company to great results. So much that a future-based language and integrity in our communication are part of the company's foundations.

Short-term results with no regard for such foundations even qualify as poor performance in our [performance review cycles](/performance-review-cycle).

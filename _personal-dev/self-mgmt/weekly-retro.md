In the end of my friday at work, I write a brief summary of my week at work. That is about myself and my team.

In this summary I try to answer these questions:

1. **Progress**: What did we achieve this week?
2. **Problems**: What issues did we face?
3. **Plans**: How am I going to approach those issues?
4. **People**: How is the team doing?

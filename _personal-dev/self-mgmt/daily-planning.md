I have two main purposes with my daily planning routine that I run every morning. First, to do a self reflection about the day. Second, to adjust the plan of my daily activities. The process is broken in 3 pieces, as follows.

## Review today's history

I'm a fan of journaling for long. This is the moment of my day where I review past events. It is like this day in my history. It makes me feel good to remember special moments, personal and professional achievements, the development of my chieldren, travelling notes and so on.

I review both my personal and my professional journals. Yeah, I keep both separated.

I write that of course in software. Currently I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as my journal and note-taking app.

## Review next activities

This is the moment where I review my agenda and next actions in my todo list, and plan what I'll address during the day. Currently I use [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) and [Todoist](https://todoist.com) as tools for that.

I may also take a look at the pending activities in my teams' boards. Usually a Kanban board in a tool such as Jira, Trello, etc.

## Review communications

First moment of the day where I check my e-mail and messaging softwares. I get up to date with that, follow-up on messages or create tasks in one of my todo lists in Todoist.

<br />

Reviewing my journals and next activities is usually quick, no more than 10 minutes. Reviewing communications may get a bit longer depending of the needs found there. I have a 30 minutes closed in my schedule every morning for this daily planning routine, but I almost never use the whole slot for it.

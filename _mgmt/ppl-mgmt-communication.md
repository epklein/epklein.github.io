Being a role model as a manager

Remember that as a manager, your word has weight as it doesn’t only come from you: it comes from an established position in the company’s org chart. As a manager you represent yourself, your team, and your company as a whole. Be a role model for those around you. (from Become an effective software engineering manager, James Stanier)

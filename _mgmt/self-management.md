Managing oneself is an important skill for life, carrer, and to manage others. Here I share a few habits and routines I keep to manage myself.

I try to follow the [GTD method](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) to get myself organized, but I also use some other techniques together with it.

## Planning Routines

There are some routines I have incorporated into my planning process.

- [Weekly Planning](/mgmt/self/weekly-planning): Every Monday, first thing in the morning;
- [Daily Planning](/mgmt/self/daily-planning): Fast daily routine to adapt the weekly plan;
- [Weekly Retro](/mgmt/self/weekly-retro): Every friday, in the end of the day, I run a retrospective of the week;
- [Monthly Retro](/mgmt/self/monthly-retro): In the last Friday  of the month, I run a retrospective for the month.

## Work Batches

Since I first read about batching, I started trying to apply the concept in my work routine.

As a manager, first time I joined a mid-size company I noticed that, if I don't take control of my schedule, other people do. In the end you have many meetings inefficiently distributed in your schedule, and many small holes of free time where you can't really be much productive or achieve something meaningful.

So I started allocating time for batching in my schedule. It is usually in the beginning of my work day. In those periods, I may focus in some important activities, or also run many small activities within the same context.

I've adopted the following recurring batching routines:

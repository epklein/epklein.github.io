In the tech industry we use progression frameworks (or '*career ladders*') to guide the development of engineers' careers.

A **career ladder** usually consists of **Designations** (Software Engineer, Product Manager, etc.), **Levels**, and **Expectations**, to measure, develop, and evaluate performance.

A typical Software Engineering (SWE) career ladder consists of:

- SWE, SWE II and Sr. SWE: The first three, and most common, levels in Software Engineering;
- Staff: They lead deep, complex, or high-risk technical projects;
- Principal: They guide the technical direction of the company;
- Distinguished and Fellow: Such levels may exist in large organizations. Like Principals, they guide the technical vision of the organization. Usually there is no standardized way to achieve this.

Performance management is a continuous process of setting objectives, assessing progress, and providing ongoing training and feedback to ensure that employees are meeting their targets and career goals. It's a broad and complex discipline that focuses on improving performance at the individual, team, and organizational levels.

Important activities in performance management include:

- **Goal Setting**: Managers and their subordinates collaboratively set clear, achievable, and measurable goals. These goals are typically aligned with the organization's objectives and the individual's role and responsibilities.
- **Performance Monitoring**: The continuous process of observing and assessing an employee's work behaviors and outcomes against the predefined standards or goals.
- **Feedback and Communication**: One of the key components of performance management is continuous feedback. Effective performance management involves regular, constructive feedback to let employees know how they're doing and where they can improve.
    - Conducting regular [one-on-one meetings](/mgmt/people/one-on-ones) is a widely recognized management practice to enable continuous feedback and enhance communication.
- **Development and Training**: The process of nurturing and developing an employee's strengths and providing them with the training and resources they need to perform their best.
- **Performance Evaluations**: Typically done annually, these evaluations provide a structured way to assess and document an employee's performance over a set period. They often influence decisions related to promotions, raises, bonuses, and, in some cases, terminations.
- **Reward and Recognition**: Recognizing and rewarding good performance is crucial. It not only motivates the concerned employee but also sets a standard for others in the organization.
- **Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs)**: For employees whose performance falls below the expected standards, managers might create a PIP. This is a formal document outlining performance deficiencies, providing guidance on how to improve, and setting timelines for expected improvement.

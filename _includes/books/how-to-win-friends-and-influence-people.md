*[How to win friends and influence people](/books/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people)* by [Dale Carnegie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Carnegie) is one of my favorite books. A must read for people that want to develop better personal and professional relationships. It is one of the best-selling books of all time, first published almost a century ago, but it is still a relevant reading about influence.

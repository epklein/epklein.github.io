DevOps is a combination of culture (people), practices and tools that integrates and automates the software development process, so that companies can plan, develop, deliver and operate faster and reliably.

It is not by definition, but usually DevOps involves the adoption of [cloud computing](/swe/cloud-computing). By the way, some cloud computing providers offer a good definition of what is DevOps, its practices and benefits. And of course their toolkit to implement DevOps. If you want to delve deeper into it, you may refer to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/) and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-devops/) definitions.

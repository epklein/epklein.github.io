DevOps is a combination of culture (people), practices and tools that integrates and automates software development and operation processes, so that companies can plan, develop, deliver and operate faster and reliably.

It is not by definition, but usually DevOps involves the adoption of [cloud computing](/swe/cloud-computing). By the way, some cloud computing providers offer a good definition of what is DevOps, its practices and benefits. And of course their toolkit to implement DevOps. If you want to delve deeper into it, you may refer to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/) and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-devops/) definitions.

## DevOps capabilities

- Communication and collaboration
- Configuration management
- Infrastructure as code
- Version control
- Trunk-based development
- Continuous integration (CI)
- [Automated testing](#automated-testing)
- Deployment automation
- Monitoring and logging
- Continuous delivery (CD)

### Automated testing

Improve quality without loosing speed by building reliable automated test suites.

Two great articles I read from Azure DevOps, about testing approaches in developing and delivering services: [shift testing left with unit tests](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/develop/shift-left-make-testing-fast-reliable) and [shift right to test in production](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/shift-right-test-production)

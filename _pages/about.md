My name is **Eduardo Klein**! I am a Brazilian **software engineering manager** and a proud **husband and father of two**. I live with my family in [Porto Alegre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre), Brazil.

I am an **experienced leader in software product development**, with the ability to **develop new leaders and manage multiple teams** in a collaborative environment. I use Lean, Agile, and DevOps practices to deliver results.

I work for **[VTEX](/about/vtex) in the digital commerce industry**. I serve as the head of engineering for the *Channel Management* team, which falls under the *Merchant Journey*. My team is responsible for developing and maintaining solutions that enable VTEX merchants to sell through external marketplaces. The team is distributed across many states in Brazil and South America, and I'm working remotely from my home town.

I also have previous experience in software development within the [financial market at Nelogica](/about/nelogica) and [mobile device management at Mobiltec](http://www.mobiltec.com.br). To learn more about my career, you can visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardopklein).

Every monday morning I run a weekly planning ritual. This is important to reflect about what comes ahead, to prioritize projects and tasks. The goal is to plan what is ahead, and not just live in auto pilot.

This is a process tailored to my needs for personal life, career and work. I'm constantly adapting it. I do not recommend anyone to follow it strictly, but to adapt it to your needs.

I run it as follows:

## Review my agenda

First thing, I review my agenda for the whole week. Currently I use [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com).

It is quite common that people from work schedule some slots in my agenda, or some important corporate events are introduced into it. This is the moment where I dedide what I'm going to attend and what I won't, and solve some conflicts that may occur. When needed, I an some async conversation to help solve it.

I know that the week won't stick perfectly to the plan. That is not the objective. The idea is to be intentional about what I'm going to prioritize during this week. Some adjustments to the plan are normal during the way. I can count on the daily planning for that.

## Review projects and tasks

This is the moment where I take a look into the big picture: Initiatives and projects, to check if I should prioritize something in any of my next actions lists. 

At work, I usually check our quarter and current cycle initiatives. At VTEX we have a 6-week planning cadence, and I check our planning tools.

For my personal life and career development, I refer to my projects in my [Todoist](https://todoist.com). I organize my projects list in areas 
If there is something I wish to proactively work on, than I put it accordingly in my schedule or in any of my next actions lists.

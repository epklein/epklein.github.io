### Books

- **[Radical Candor](https://www.amazon.com/Radical-Candor-Revised-Kick-Ass-Humanity/dp/1250235375)**, by [Kim Scott](https://kimmalonescott.com/). A reference for managers who want to improve their ability in giving feedback. The book is a collection of ideas on how to give candid feedback, by caring personally and challenging directly.

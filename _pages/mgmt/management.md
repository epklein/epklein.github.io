Management is a broad discipline. In this page I share resources and references covering a variety of management branches.

I have a special page dedicated to [Software Engineering Management](/mgmt/swe), the main focus of my career.

## Disciplines

- [People Management](/mgmt/people): The act of achieving results through other people.

## Recommended reading

### Books

- **[Radical Candor](https://amzn.to/3v7hfok)**, by [Kim Scott](https://kimmalonescott.com/). A reference for managers who want to improve their ability in giving feedback. The book is a collection of ideas on how to give candid feedback, by caring personally and challenging directly.

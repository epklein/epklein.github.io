Managing oneself is an important skill for life, carrer, and to manage others. Here I share a few habits and routines I keep to manage myself.

# Planning routines

Conjunto de rotinas que incorporo no meu planejamento. Elas atendem as rotinas do método GTD, mas não se limitam ao seu escopo. Aqui eu incluo introspecção e reflexão também.

- [Planejamento Semanal](/mgmt/self/weekly-planning): Toda segunda-feira pela manhã faço o meu planejamento semanal.
- [Planejamento Diário](/mgmt/self/daily-planning): Rápida rotina diária para ajuste revisão e ajuste do planejamento.
- [Revisão Semanal](/mgmt/self/weekly-retro): Sexta-feira, ao final do expediente de trabalho, faço minha revisão semanal.
- [Retrospectiva Mensal](/mgmt/self/monthly-retro): Na última sexta-feira do mês faço uma retrospectiva do ciclo que se passou.

# Work batches

Since I first read about batching, I started trying to apply the concept in my work routine.

In the end you have many meetings inefficiently distributed in your schedule, and many small holes of free time where you can't really be much productive or achieve something meaningful.

So I started allocating time for batching in my schedule. It is usually in the beginning of my work day. In those periods, I may focus in some important activities, or also run many small activities in the same context.

I've adopted the following recurring batching routines:

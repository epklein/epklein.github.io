{: .notice}

Each new one-on-one meeting is logged at the top of the shared document, with the date included in the title, to maintain a record of the meetings.

### Agenda

{: .notice}

This is where participants input items for the meeting in advance. Additional items discussed during the one-on-one are also appended to the agenda.

- [Alice] Next performance review cycle
- [Alice] Initiatives for Q4 planning

### Notes

{: .notice}

It is where participants record notes on discussion points, decisions, and next actions. I prefer to highlight the next actions in bold; however, they could also optionally be placed in another section named "to-do" or "next actions".

#### Initiatives for Q4 Planning
- Hosting efficiency is a main engineering objective;
- Prioritization themes are declared in *this document*;
- **Edu will schedule a meeting with the PM to elucidate priorities**.

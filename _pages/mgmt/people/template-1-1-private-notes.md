## Notes

### 2022-09-21 - Release problems

Alice failed to properly monitor her last deployment, which resulted in a high error rate when it was pushed to production. As a result, we spent 2 hours rolling back to the previous version. This was not the first time this happened, so I need to establish clearer expectations and have an open conversation about this incident.

In this page I share resources about **Software Engineering Management**.

But what is Software Engineering Management? Well, I don't have a formal definition for it. But I see it as **the application of [Management](/mgmt) activities focused in the development and maintenance of software**. Do you have a better definition for it? Please let me know!

A Software Engineering Manager tipically:

- Manages the design and the development of software applications or services;
- Directs or supports the work of Software Engineers to promote best practices and to foster improvement;
- Have a good comprehension of software development. Including topics such as programming, testing, build, deploy & delivery, software architecture & design, and many more.

**There are a variety of software development concepts, practices, tools, etc, important to be understood**. I intent to write about some of them, such as:

- [DevOps](/swe/devops), [Cloud computing](/swe/cloud-computing), Microservices.

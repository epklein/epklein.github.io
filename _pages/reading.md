In this page I share the books I'm currently reading. I also share a collection of books that I've already read and I would recommend for everyone.

I have also separate reading lists in the main topics I write about in this blog: [Leadership](/leadership), [Management](/mgmt), [Software Engineering Management](/mgmt/swe) and its branches.

### Currently reading

Here I share my currently reading list, as well as my book recommendations. I also put together the top blogs and newsletters I like to follow to keep up to date.

I have also separate reading lists in the main topics I write about in this blog, such as [Leadership](/leadership), [management](/mgmt), and [software engineering management](/mgmt/swe), among others.

In this page I share the books I am currently reading. I also share a collection of books that I've already read and I would recommend to everyone.

I have also separate reading lists in the main topics I write about in this blog: [Leadership](/leadership), [management](/mgmt), and [software engineering management](/mgmt/swe) and its many branches.

### Currently reading

- {% include book-ref-accelerate.md %}
- *[How the World Really Works](https://amzn.to/3RpuBWN)* by Vaclav Smil. A reading recommendation I've received from a [Bill Gates recommended reading video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksImBkJNQt8) and I became really interested in.

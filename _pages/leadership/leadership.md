This page is a collection of resources I consider relevant about leadership. I understand leadership as **the ability of an individual to influence and guide other people**.

## Recommended reading

- **How to win friends and influence people**, by [Dale Carnegie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Carnegie). It is one of the best-selling books of all time, first published in 1936, almost a century ago. And it is still a relevant reading about influence, full of techniques in handling people, making people like you and bringing people to your way of thinking. A must read for people that want to develop better personal and professional relationships.

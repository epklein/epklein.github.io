Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) is a psychological approach that focuses on analyzing strategies employed by successful individuals and applying these strategies to [communication](/leadership/communication), [personal development](/personal-dev), and psychotherapy. It was first developed by [Richard Bandler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bandler) and [John Grinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Grinder).

It's important to note that NLP has faced criticism and is labeled pseudoscience due to a lack of scientific validation.

Despite the criticism, I believe that NLP offers valuable tools to enhance communication. This is why I chose to explore it on the site. I hold an NLP Practitioner certification and have some background in its techniques.

One of those great tools is the [Meta-Model](/nlp-meta-model). This linguistic tool helps identify and challenge language patterns that distort, delete, and generalize experience, aiming to clarify and enhance communication.

Communication can occur through several mediums, and its choice can significantly influence the effectiveness of the communication.

## Verbal

This is the most common medium for humans. **It refers to using words and speaking to convey information between individuals synchronously**. It can be face-to-face, over the telephone, or even over a video call.

It is a natural and effective form of communication, allowing for real-time feedback and exchange of ideas. **Its effectiveness depends on many aspects, including listening skills, oratory, emotional intelligence, and interpersonal skills**.

## Written

**This involves any interaction that uses the written word**. It is a fundamental method in business and personal settings and includes formats like documents, letters, e-mails, text messages, etc.

Written communication provides a permanent record of information and is effective for complex instructions or information that needs to be referenced over time.

**In many modern businesses, written communication is critical to allowing distributed and asynchronous work to happen effectively**. In the Tech industry, we are used to working asynchronously in teams by communicating over instant messaging apps and e-mail, iterating over documents and source code, managing projects through digital documents, etc.

## Nonverbal

**It involves conveying messages without the use of words**. It may include body language, gestures, vocal variety, etc.

**Non-verbal communication usually accompanies verbal communication and can reinforce or contradict the spoken message**. Understanding and effectively using non-verbal cues is crucial for effective communication.

Watch the video I shared in a blog post about [Effective Communication](/effective-communication) to see an example of nonverbal communication being used effectively.

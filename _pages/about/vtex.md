VTEX was founded in [Rio de Janeiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro), Brazil, in the year 2000. The company's focus is a SaaS e-commerce platform for enterprises. The international expansion started in 2013, first in Latam, later in North America, Europe, and then globally.

When I joined VTEX, the company was structuring the IPO in the [New York Stock Exchange](https://www.nyse.com/) (NYSE). The company went public on July 21st, 2021, under the stock quote [VTEX](https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:VTEX).
